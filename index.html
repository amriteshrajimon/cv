  <h1>Amritesh Rajimon</h1>
  <p><em>student from <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">udemy</a></strong></em></p>
  <p>I was a gamer.I would normally play games like <strong>pubg mobile,call of duty mordern warfare 3 counter strike condition zero charset
      and other games</strong> which was free ofcource.Still though i found out about telegram where i met a friend who was just like me but know more charset
    than me it didnt took long to till we became best friend atleast for me. But lucky for him there were many fans of his who would hang around him
    when ever he is out.I out of them he didnt got time to even notice me I was just trying to make friends then at school these 4 guys stumbled upon
    me who called me their friend for some reason because the only thing they do is make fun of me.still I tried to keep my cool and became friends with them
    the thing is in this world if you not rich enough or not beautiful enough you dont have any value amoung these people who call me their friends.To be honest
    i had little crush okay fine huge crush on a girl i cant say her name if I did next thing will happen is she would ride a bulldosser through me.
    One day the famous guy who every one was hanging on to was studdenly nobody then finally we were able to talk then we shared our experiences.At that point we
    both realised we both were hoping too much from this world and was being mad over the things which cannot be controlled us.I TRULY DONT KNOW WHY I WROTE BUT
    I FEEL SOME KIND OF RELIEF AFTER SHARING MY FEELING AND YES DONT ASK FOR HER NAME ;) </p>
